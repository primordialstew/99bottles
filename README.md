# 99bottles
[99 Bottles of Object Oriented Programming](99bottles) is a book by
[Sandi Metz](Metz) and [Katrina Owen](Owen). It encourages the reader to
"code-along" as the authors explore the _process_ of writing clean,
intelligible, low-cost software by walking us through a Test-Driven Development
implementation of the famous ditty "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall".


## This repository
This repository contains my work on the project as I code along in Python (as
opposed to the authors' Ruby). I may also include excerpts from and thoughts on
the book itself.
